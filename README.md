# html5up-story-nojs

A responsive website HTML+CSS website template.

This template is based on [the Story template by HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/story), with minor modifications to remove the JavaScript.

I wanted a JavaScript-free version of this beautiful template to simplify the foundation and allow for custom JavaScript that may have conflicted with the existing implementation. It also functions fine as-is with no JS at all.

All credit goes to HTML5 UP, I just removed stuff.

Say hello to Story, a brand new responsive one-pager for HTML5 UP! Inspired by my work
on Carrd*, Story is built to be extremely modular and tweakable, and as such is entirely
built on reusable, insanely customizable elements (like "spotlight" and "gallery") that
can be endlessly duplicated and tweaked into whatever you need to tell your story --
without, in many cases, touching *any* CSS. Check out index-demo.html for an interactive
demo, and index.html for the actual template. Enjoy!

PS: Delete index-demo.html and assets/js/demo.js when you're done messing with the demo
as neither are needed in production :)
